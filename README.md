## Abstract
##### Increasing customer requirements with respect to quality and delivery time of products as well as the increasing pricing pressure result in progressive interdependencies in production networks. Consequently, the complexity of the processes in these networks increases, making it more difficult to foresee the effects of local disruptions on the entire network. 
##### Therefore, this simulation model was developed as a tool to simulate the effects of these disturbances and thus to make the connections in the network more transparent. The quality and performance of the simulated production networks are evaluated using a performance indicator system. One key aspect is the modularity: The model is applicable to different production network structures. Another aspect is the user-friendly implementation and design of the simulation model in order to ensure the practical use of the tool. 
##### This simulation model was developed at the wbk Institute of Production Science which is part of the Karlsruhe Institute for Technology (KIT) within the scope of the research project PlanQ.
